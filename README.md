## Header
* the Header includes My name and site navigation. 
* The About Me, Work and Contact links will take the user down the page to the desired area.
* The resume is a placeholder link at this time. 

## Hero 
* The hero section includes a photo of the New Mexico Sunset <img srs="./assets/images/sunset.jpg"> and a cool tag line. 

## About Me
* The About Me section tells a little bit about my journey as a developer and includes a current photo: <img src="../assets/images/AKS-headshot.jpg">

## Work
* The Work section showcases 5 work products. 2 deployed projects https://roadrunnercapitol.com and http://aksmith5239.github.io/run-buddy. 3 placeholder projects. 

* The five grid boxes are links that will take the visitor to examples of the work products. They also include a gradient that appears when the user hovers over the box.

## Contact Me
* The Contact section links will let the user contact me via email or phone, or link to my GitHub and LinkedIn pages when clicked. 
* The email when clicked will open an email box with my address on the "to" line.
* The phone link when clicked from a cell phone will call the number I have listed. 

## Responsive Design
* The site will resize when viewed on a smaller screen. 
* The five grid boxes containg the work products will move out of their grid display and stack. 
* The navigation element and the contact list will both move from inline display and each link will stack on top of one another. 
* On a cell phone, the biography photo will not be visible.
