## Work
* The Work section showcases 5 work products. 2 deployed projects <a href="https://roadrunnercapitol.com">Link to Roadrunner Capitol Reports</a> and a href="http://aksmith5239.github.io/run-buddy">Link to Run Buddy Deployed on GitHub page</a>. 3 placeholder projects. 

* The five grid boxes are links that will take the visitor to examples of the work products. They also include a gradient that appears when the user hovers over the box.

## Responsive Design
* The site will resize when viewed on a smaller screen. 
* The five grid boxes containg the work products will move out of their grid display and stack. 
* The navigation element and the contact list will both move from inline display and each link will stack on top of one another. 
* On a cell phone, the biography photo will not be visible.
